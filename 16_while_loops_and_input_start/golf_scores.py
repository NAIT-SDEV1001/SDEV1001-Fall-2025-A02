print("Golf Score Calculator")

# I want you to keep track of a couple of things
# the amount of scores entered
# the total score that the user entered

# use a while loop to check if the user has entered
# 1. a score (which you keep track of)
# 2. if they wrote "quit" which exit the loop

# at then end print the average score.
